Speech-to-Speech LLM Bot
This project is a voice-powered assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process spoken input and generate intelligent spoken responses. It enables seamless, natural interaction through speech recognition, AI-driven responses, and text-to-speech conversion.

Key Features
Speech Recognition: Uses Googleâ€™s Speech Recognition API to convert spoken input into text.
LLM Integration: Leverages Gemini 1.5 LLM to generate accurate and context-aware responses.
Text-to-Speech: Converts AI-generated text back into speech using pyttsx3 for a fully voice-driven experience.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter for intuitive and interactive engagement.
Installation
Run the following commands to set up the environment:

pip install tkinter SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 google-generativeai
Components
Tkinter GUI: Provides an interactive and easy-to-use interface.
Speech Recognition: Captures and converts speech into text.
Generative AI: Processes input and generates meaningful responses.
Text-to-Speech: Converts AI-generated text into spoken output for a smooth conversation flow.
